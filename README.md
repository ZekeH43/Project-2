# Project Title

## Overview

Welcome to Are You a Fraud! This project involves an in-depth analysis utilizing machine learning models to predict if a credit card transaction is fraudulent or authentic. Below, you'll find an overview of the analysis, the dataset, the models used, and the key results.

## Analysis Overview

### Purpose of the Analysis

The primary objective of this analysis is to read in credit card transactions and train our machine learning model to more accuratly predict credit card fraud. We aim to leverage machine learning models to predict [specify what you aimed to predict] based on financial information in the provided dataset.

### Financial Information and Prediction Target

#### Financial Data

The dataset contains eight variables of data that include distance from home, distance from last transaction, ration to median purchase price, repeat retailer, used chip, used pin number, online order, and fraud. These variable can provide valuable insights into the validity of the credit card transactions on our provided dataset.

#### Prediction Target

Our target variable for prediction is [mention the target variable]. The distribution of fraud and non-fraud instances is as follows:

- Fraud: 
- Non-Fraud: 

### Variables and Stages of Machine Learning Process

#### Variables

Key variables in the analysis include distance from home, distance from last transaction, ration to median purchase price, repeat retailer, used chip, used pin number, online order, and fraud, contributing to the understanding of the authenticity of a given transaction.

#### Stages of Machine Learning Process
